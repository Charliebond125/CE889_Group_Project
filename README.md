CE889 Oct Start 2022 group project.

This is the starter repository for us individuals in team 8 for the CE889 Group Project.

Below is the link to the rossman-store-sales dataset.

<h2> Group Project CE889 <h2>
• The group project consist of designing the most appropriate deep learning
architecture for the Rossmann Stores sales Kaggle Competition
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).

• The group will then implement in python the designed solution using
TensorFlow or PyTorch.

• The deep learning model should be trained with the data provided in the
Kaggle competition and then a file with the predictions of the testing dataset
should be submitted to the competition to get a performance metric from the
website. This evaluation metric should be shown during the final presentation.

• At least one deep learning architecture should be used. A MLP with one or
more hidden layers is NOT a valid architecture for this part of the assignment.
